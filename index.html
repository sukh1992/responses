		<h1>The Crystal Goblet</h1>
		
		<h2>Printing Should Be Invisible by Beatrice Warde<br> (1900 -- 1969)</h2>
		<h3>
			Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your<br> own favourite
vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a<br>deep shimmering crimson in
colour. You have two goblets before you.<br>One is of solid gold, wrought in the most
exquisite patterns. The other<br>is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent.
Pour and drink; <br>and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you
are a<br>connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other,<br>
you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost<br>
thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs <br>of fine
vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about it is <br>calculated to reveal
rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain.<br>
Bear with me in this long-winded and fragrant metaphor; for you will find that almost<br>all
the virtues of the perfect wine-glass have a parallel in typography. There is the long,<br> thin
stem that obviates fingerprints on the bowl. Why? Because no cloud must come <br>between
your eyes and the fiery heart of the liquid. Are not the margins on book pages <br>
