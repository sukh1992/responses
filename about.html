			<h1>The Crystal Goblet</h1>
		
		<p>Bear with me in this long-winded and fragrant metaphor; for you will find that almost all
the virtues of the perfect wine-glass have a parallel in typography. There is the long, thin
stem that obviates fingerprints on the bowl. Why? Because no cloud must come between
your eyes and the fiery heart of the liquid. Are not the margins on book pages similarly
meant to obviate the necessity of fingering the type-page? Again: the glass is colourless or at
the most only faintly tinged in the bowl, because the connoisseur judges wine partly by its
colour and is impatient of anything that alters it. There are a thousand mannerisms in
typography that are as impudent and arbitrary as putting port in tumblers of red or green
glass! When a goblet has a base that looks too small for security, it does not matter how
cleverly it is weighted; you feel nervous lest it should tip over. There are ways of setting
lines of type which may work well enough, and yet keep the reader subconsciously worried
by the fear of 'doubling' lines, reading three words as one, and so forth.</p>
		
		<p>CNow the man who first chose glass instead of clay or metal to hold his wine was a
'modernist' in the sense in which I am going to use that term. That is, the first thing he
asked of his particular object was not 'How should it look?' but 'What must it do?' and to
that extent all good typography is modernist.</p>

		<p>
			Wine is so strange and potent a thing that it has been used in the central ritual of religion
in one place and time, and attacked by a virago with a hatchet in another. There is only
one thing in the world that is capable of stirring and altering men's minds to the same
extent, and that is the coherent expression of thought. That is man's chief miracle, unique
to man. There is no 'explanation' whatever of the fact that I can make arbitrary sounds
which will lead a total stranger to think my own thought. It is sheer magic that I should be
able to hold a one-sided conversation by means of black marks on paper with an unknown person half-way across the world. Talking, broadcasting, writing, and printing are all quite
literally forms of thought transference, and it is the ability and eagerness to transfer and
receive the contents of the mind that is almost alone responsible for human civilization.
		</p>

			If you agree with this, you will agree with my one main idea, i.e. that the most important
thing about printing is that it conveys thought, ideas, images, from one mind to other
minds. This statement is what you might call the front door of the science of typography.
Within lie hundreds of rooms; but unless you start by assuming that printing is meant to
convey specific and coherent ideas, it is very easy to find yourself in the wrong house
altogether.
		</p>

		<p>
			Before asking what this statement leads to, let us see what it does not necessarily lead to. If
books are printed in order to be read, we must distinguish readability from what the optician
would call legibility. A page set in 14-pt Bold Sans is, according to the laboratory tests, more
'legible' than one set in 11-pt Baskerville. A public speaker is more 'audible' in that sense
when he bellows. But a good speaking voice is one which is inaudible as a voice. It is the
transparent goblet again! I need not warn you that if you begin listening to the inflections
and speaking rhythms of a voice from a platform, you are falling asleep. When you listen to
a song in a language you do not understand, part of your mind actually does fall asleep,
leaving your quite separate aesthetic sensibilities to enjoy themselves unimpeded by your
reasoning faculties. The fine arts do that; but that is not the purpose of printing. Type well
used is invisible as type, just as the perfect talking voice is the unnoticed vehicle for the
transmission of words, ideas.
